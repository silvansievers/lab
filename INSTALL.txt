Choose a destination for the lab package, install the dependencies and
clone the repository::

    LAB=/path/to/lab
    sudo apt-get install mercurial python2.7 python-matplotlib python-simplejson
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jendrikseipp/lab ${LAB}

Notes about requirements:

* lab needs Python 2.7. Python 3 is not supported.
* python-matplotlib is only needed for reports that generate graphs.
* python-simplejson is optional, but makes generating reports much faster.

Append to your ``.bashrc`` to make lab available on the ``PYTHONPATH``::

    LAB=~/path/to/lab
    if [ -z "$PYTHONPATH" ]; then
        export PYTHONPATH=${LAB}
    else
        export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${LAB}
    fi

Update shell configuration::

    source ~/.bashrc
