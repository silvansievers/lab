Lab and Downward Lab
====================

**Lab** is a Python package for running code on a large set of
benchmarks. Experiments can be conducted on a single machine or on a
cluster. The package also contains code for parsing results and creating
reports. Currently, Lab and Downward Lab are distributed together.

The **Downward Lab** Python package facilitates running experiments for
the `Fast Downward <http://www.fast-downward.org>`_ planning system. It
