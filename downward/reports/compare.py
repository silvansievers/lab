        *compared_configs* is a list of tuples of 2 or 3 elements. The first two entries
        in each tuple are configs that should be compared. If a third entry is present it
        is used as the name of the column showing the difference between the two configs.
        Otherwise the column will be named 'Diff'.
        All columns in the report will be arranged such that the configurations that are
        compared are next to each other. After those two columns a diff column is added
        that shows the difference between the two values. If a config occurs in more than
        one comparison it is repeated every time. Configs that are in the original data
        but are not mentioned in compared_configs are not printed.
        For example if the data contains configs A, B, C and D and *compared_configs* is
        ``[('A', 'B', 'Diff BA'), ('A', 'C')]`` the resulting columns will be
        A, B, Diff BA (contains B - A), A, C , Diff (contains C - A).
